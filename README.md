# Socialoon
Ever felt alone in a big city? This is the prototype for an app, which helps you to find new people by providing a map on that you can find nearby casual meetups.

The development process was very challenging. I worked on this project for six months in an one-man team and started without any Android SDK experience. Therefore I'm quite happy with the final result.
